1 DYNAMIC MODELS OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCESSES



1.1 Stirred-Tank Heating Process: Constant Holdup


Consider the stirred-tank heating system shown in Fig. 2.3.
The liquid inlet stream consists of a single component with a mass flow rate MATH0000 and an inlet temperature MATH0001.
The tank contents are agitated and heated using an electrical heater that provides a heating rate, MATH0002.
A dynamic model will be developed based on the following assumptions:


1. 

Perfect mixing: thus, the exit temperature MATH0003 is also the temperature of the tank contents.



2. 

The inlet and outlet flow rates are equal; thus, MATH0000=MATH0004 and the liquid holdup MATH0005 is constant.



3. 

The density MATH0006 and heat capacity MATH0007 of the liquid are assumed to be constant. Thus, their temperature dependence is neglected.



4. 

Heat losses are negligible.



In general, dynamic models are based on conservation laws.
For this example, it is clear that we should consider an energy balance, because thermal effects predominate.
A mass balance is not required in view of Assumptions 2 and 3.


Next, we show how the general energy balance in Eq. 2-10 can be simplified for this particular example.
For a pure liquid at low or moderate pressures, the internal energy is approximately equal to the enthalpy, MATH0008≈MATH0009, and MATH0009 depends only on temperature (Sandler, 2006).
Consequently, in the subsequent development, we assume that MATH0008=MATH0009 and U^_int=MATH0009^ where the caret (^) means per unit mass.
As shown in Appendix C, a differential change in temperature MATH0010⁢MATH0003, produces a corresponding change in the internal energy per unit mass, MATH0010⁢U^_int,




MATH0010⁢U^_int=MATH0010⁢MATH0009^=MATH0007⁢MATH0010⁢MATH0003

(2-29)


where MATH0007 is the constant pressure heat capacity (assumed to be constant).
The total internal energy of the liquid in the tank can be expressed as the product of U^_int and the mass in the tank, MATH0006⁢MATH0005:




MATH0008=MATH0006⁢MATH0005⁢U^_int

(2-30)


An expression for the rate of internal energy accumulation can be derived from Eqs. 2-29 and 2-30:




MATH0010⁢MATH0008MATH0010⁢MATH0011=MATH0006⁢MATH0005⁢MATH0007⁢MATH0010⁢MATH0003MATH0010⁢MATH0011

(2-31)


Note that this term appears in the general energy balance of Eq. 2-10.


Next, we derive an expression for the enthalpy term that appears on the right-hand side of Eq. 2-10.
Suppose that the liquid in the tank is at a temperature MATH0003 and has an enthalpy, MATH0009^.
Integrating Eq. 2-29 from a reference temperature MATH0003ref to MATH0003 gives




MATH0009^-MATH0009^ref=MATH0007⁢(MATH0003-MATH0003ref)

(2-32)


where MATH0009^ref is the value of MATH0009^ at MATH0003ref.
Without loss of generality, we assume that MATH0009^ref=0 (see Appendix C).
Thus, (2-32) can be written as:




MATH0009^=MATH0007⁢(MATH0003-MATH0003ref)

(2-33)


Similarly, for the inlet stream:




MATH0009^i=MATH0007⁢(MATH0001-MATH0003ref)

(2-34)


Substituting (2-33) and (2-34) into the convection term of (2-10) gives:




-MATH0013⁢(MATH0004⁢MATH0009^)=MATH0004⁢[MATH0007⁢(MATH0001-MATH0003ref)]-MATH0004⁢[MATH0007⁢(MATH0003-MATH0003ref)]

(2-35)


Finally, substitution of (2-31) and (2-35) into (2-10) gives the desired dynamic model of the stirred-tank heating system:




MATH0005⁢MATH0006⁢MATH0007⁢MATH0010⁢MATH0003MATH0010⁢MATH0011=MATH0004⁢MATH0007⁢(MATH0001-MATH0003)+MATH0002

(2-36)


Note that the MATH0003ref terms have canceled, because MATH0007 was assumed to be constant, and thus independent of temperature.


A degrees of freedom analysis for this model gives





3 parameters:

MATH0005, MATH0006, MATH0007



4 variables:

MATH0003, MATH0001, MATH0004, MATH0002



1 equation:
Eq. 2-36





Thus, the degrees of freedom are MATH0014=4-1=3.
The process variables are classified as:





1 output variable:
MATH0003


3 input variables:

MATH0001, MATH0004, MATH0002






For control purposes, it is reasonable to classify the three inputs as





2 disturbance variables:

MATH0001, MATH0004



1 manipulated variable:
MATH0002
